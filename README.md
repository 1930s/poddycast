# Poddycast [BETA] :construction:

A Podcast app made with Electron because I love Podcasts.

![screenshot_1](img/poddycastapp.png)

Search for any Podcasts you like (using **iTunes**) and see if you already marked this Podcasts as favorite.
Find all episodes in the **New Episodes** menu item.
See all your **favorite Podcasts** in one place.
And search through the **history** of podcasts you listened to.

You can also create **playlists** to keep your Podcast collection nice and clean.
